# AutoHotkeys-Example-Work
An Auto Hotkeys Automation tool created to not only bridge the gap between Excel and TN3270Plus but to automate frequent task with changing variables in the TN3270Plus Console.

Hello Reader,

The AutoHotkey Tools - 2.06.ahk was designed to do a multitude of task by not only bridging the gap between TN3270PLUS
and Microsoft Excel (Both of which have their own "macro" functionality) allowing them to talk to eachother and share
information but it also accepts parameters and navigates the database to enact a task based off the parameters.

Now where to begin. The unfortunate news, this tool was made for a very specific application (TN3270Plus)
and to interact with the database of the company I was working for. It not only requires said application to work,
but it has tons of safeguards to prevent accidental activation, accidental changes when none should be made, and etc.
In short, it won't do what it suppose to do but it will let you navigate the menus, change values, and etc.

To start, simple open up the "AutoHotkey Tools - 2.06.ahk" file. It will start up and load to the main menu.
